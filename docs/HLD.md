This High Level Design (HLD) document outlines the architecture and core design of GridInsightPro -
Smart Energy Demand Forecaster, a web application for energy providers to forecast demand using
big data and AI. The platform enables secure data upload, real-time analytics, anomaly detection, and
collaborative planning.
Project Name
GridInsightPro - Smart Energy Demand Forecaster
Purpose:
To provide energy providers with accurate, AI-driven demand forecasts, real-time analytics, anomaly
detection, and collaborative planning tools for effective grid management.
1. System Architecture Overview
Architecture Summary:
GridInsightPro is a cloud-native, modular web application deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It
consists of a React-based frontend, Python REST APIs, distributed data processing, AI/ML services,
and secure storage.
Main System Modules
Module Role
Frontend UI User interface for data upload, visualization, and collaboration
Backend API Handles business logic, user management, and orchestrates workflows
Data Processing Distributed ingestion, validation, and transformation of datasets
AI/ML Engine Generates demand forecasts and detects anomalies
Real-Time Analytics Streams and updates live consumption metrics
Storage Layer Stores raw/processed data, models, and audit logs
Auth/Security Manages authentication, authorization, and audit logging
2. Component Interactions
Sequence Step Interaction Description
1. User Login Frontend authenticates via OAuth2 (GCP IAM)
2. Data Upload User uploads data; API validates and stores in Cloud Storage
3. Data Processing Backend triggers Spark jobs (Dataproc) for ingestion and transformation
4. Forecast/Anomaly
Request
API invokes AI/ML engine for predictions and anomaly detection
5. Visualization Frontend fetches processed data, forecasts, and anomalies via REST API
6. Collaboration Users create/share scenarios and comments; API manages shared
workspaces
7. Audit Logging All actions logged for compliance and traceability
3. Data Flow Overview
Data Flow Step Source Destination Description
Data Upload User (UI)
Cloud
Storage Secure upload of CSV/Excel files
Data Processing Cloud Storage BigQuery Spark jobs validate, clean, and store data
Forecast/Anomaly
Generation
BigQuery AI/ML Engine Data fed to models for predictions/alerts
Results Delivery AI/ML Engine Frontend (UI)
Forecasts/anomalies visualized and
exported
Collaboration Data Frontend (UI) Backend API Scenario planning and comments stored
Audit Logs All
Components
Storage User actions and data changes logged
4. Technology Stack
Layer Technology/Tooling
Frontend Next.js, React, D3.js/Chart.js
Backend API Python (FastAPI/Flask), REST
Data Processing Apache Spark (GCP Dataproc)
ML/AI Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
Storage GCP BigQuery, Cloud Storage
Auth/Security GCP IAM, OAuth2, TLS 1.2+
Deployment GCP Cloud Run, GitHub Actions
5. Scalability, Reliability & Security
Scalability:
Distributed Spark jobs and GCP managed services enable scaling to 100+ users and 1TB+
data.
Auto-scaling via Cloud Run and Dataproc.
Reliability:
Target uptime â‰¥ 99.5% with managed GCP infrastructure.
Data upload/processing latency < 2 minutes for 10GB files.
Security:
End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.2+), strict IAM roles, and audit logging.
Role-based access control (Admin, Analyst, Viewer).
