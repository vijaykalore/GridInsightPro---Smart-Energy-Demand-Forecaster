Project Name
GridInsightPro - Smart Energy Demand Forecaster
Overview
GridInsightPro is a web application enabling energy providers to forecast demand using big data and
AI. The platform allows users to upload consumption data, visualize regional trends, and receive
predictive insights for grid management. Key features include real-time analytics, anomaly detection,
and collaborative planning tools.
1. Objectives
Objective Description
Accurate Demand Forecasting Provide AI-driven, high-accuracy demand forecasts for energy providers.
Real-Time Analytics Enable live monitoring and analysis of energy consumption data.
Anomaly Detection Identify and alert on unusual consumption patterns.
Collaborative Planning Facilitate team-based scenario planning and decision-making.
2. Target Users
User Type Description
Grid Operators Monitor, forecast, and manage grid demand.
Data Analysts Analyze trends and anomalies in consumption.
Planners/Managers Collaborate on grid management strategies.
3. Core Features
Feature Description
Data Upload Secure upload of CSV/Excel consumption data.
Data Visualization Interactive dashboards for regional and temporal trends.
Predictive Insights AI/ML-based demand forecasts (short/long-term).
Real-Time Analytics Live data streaming and instant metric updates.
Anomaly Detection Automated detection and alerting of outliers.
Collaborative Tools Shared workspaces, comments, and scenario planning.
User Management Role-based access control and audit logs.
4. Functional Requirements
ID Requirement
FR1 Users can upload and validate large datasets (up to 10GB) in CSV/Excel formats.
FR2 System processes and stores data using distributed Spark jobs on GCP.
FR3 Users can view interactive charts (line, bar, heatmap) of consumption by region/time.
FR4 AI/ML models (Python) generate demand forecasts; results are visualized and downloadable.
FR5 Real-time analytics dashboard updates with live data streams.
FR6 Anomaly detection flags and notifies users of irregular patterns.
FR7 Users can create, share, and comment on planning scenarios.
FR8 Role-based permissions: Admin, Analyst, Viewer.
FR9 Audit logs track data uploads, changes, and user actions.
5. Non-Functional Requirements
ID Requirement
NFR1 System uptime ≥ 99.5%.
NFR2 Data upload and processing latency < 2 minutes for 10GB files.
NFR3 Forecast accuracy ≥ 95% (measured by MAPE on test data).
NFR4 Secure data storage and encrypted transmission (TLS 1.2+).
NFR5 Scalable to 100 concurrent users and 1TB data.
NFR6 Responsive UI (load time < 2s on modern browsers).
